# Foundations
*Theses, visions, and philosophical frameworks that guide my research and projects.*

This section is the **intellectual bedrock** of my work. Here, I share my core ideas, theses, and visions—exploring how **science, ethics, and ecology** intersect to shape technology and innovation. Each post links to related projects in [Applied Works]({{ "/Applied-Works/" | relative_url }}) or research in [Exploring Frontiers]({{ "/Exploring-Frontiers/" | relative_url }}).
