# *Original research across mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, and philosophy.*

This section is my **personal research lab**—where I dive deep into advanced topics, test hypotheses, and develop original ideas. Each sub-section represents a discipline I study independently, often connecting to my [theses]({{ "/Foundations/" | relative_url }}) and [applied projects]({{ "/Applied-Works/" | relative_url }}).
