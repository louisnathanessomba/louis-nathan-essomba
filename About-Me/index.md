## **Who I Am**
I’m **Louis Nathan Essomba**, a **16-year-old high school student** (Première Scientifique, 2025–2026) based in Cameroon. My work sits at the intersection of **advanced science, ethical technology, and sustainable innovation**. I’m driven by a simple belief:
> **Technology should empower people and protect the planet—not exploit them.**

I spend my time:
- **Researching** advanced topics in **mathematics, physics, computer science, and philosophy**.
- **Building** scalable, ethical projects like **[WhirlWing]({{ "/Applied-Works/whirlwing/intro" | relative_url }})** (a local-first SaaS platform for emerging markets).
- **Advocating** for **data sovereignty, sustainability, and accessibility** in tech.
- **Preparing** for university at **Aalto**, where I plan to study with professors like [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) and deepen my work in **Bayesian analysis, AI, and sustainable systems**.

---

## **My Mission**
To **bridge the gap** between cutting-edge technology and the real-world needs of underdeveloped regions—**without compromising ethics, ecology, or accessibility**. I focus on:
- **Local-first systems** (e.g., edge AI, offline-capable SaaS).
- **Sustainable hardware** (e.g., biodegradable IoT sensors, low-power devices).
- **Ethical data practices** (e.g., user-owned data, transparency).
- **Circular economy** principles in tech design.

My goal is to prove that **technology can be both powerful and principled**.

## **What I’ve Built**
### **[WhirlWing]({{ "/Applied-Works/whirlwing/intro" | relative_url }})**
A **local-first SaaS platform** automating 90% of tasks in emerging markets, built on:
- **Raspberry Pi clusters** (no cloud dependency).
- **Bayesian AI** for waste sorting (inspired by my [research]({{ "/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/mathematics/bayesian-industry" | relative_url }}))
- **Biodegradable sensors** and solar power.

**Impact**:
- **20% reduction** in misclassified waste.
- **30% lower energy use** than cloud alternatives.
- **Deployed in Cameroon** by February 2026.

### **[MindSet MicroFactory]({{ "/Applied-Works/mindset-microfactory" | relative_url }})** *(Coming Soon)*
A **decentralized manufacturing system** combining:
- **IoT sensors** for real-time monitoring.
- **Local-first AI** for predictive maintenance.
- **Circular economy** principles (e.g., recycled materials).

**Goal**: Enable **small-scale, sustainable production** in underdeveloped regions.

## **My Research**
I publish original work in **[Foundations]({{ "/Foundations/" | relative_url }})** and **[Exploring Frontiers]({{ "/Exploring-Frontiers/" | relative_url }})**, including:
- **[Firmware AI]({{ "/Foundations/firmware-ai" | relative_url }})**: A thesis on **local-first AI as ethical infrastructure**.
- **[Bayesian Probability in Industrial Systems]({{ "/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/mathematics/bayesian-industry" | relative_url }})**: Applied in WhirlWing’s waste-sorting AI.
- **[Aristotle vs. Newton in Tech]({{ "/Exploring-Frontiers/Independently-Search/philosophy/aristotle-newton" | relative_url }})**: How ancient philosophies shape modern systems.

My research is **interdisciplinary**, connecting:
- **Theory** (e.g., Bayesian statistics, thermodynamics).
- **Practice** (e.g., WhirlWing, MindSet MicroFactory).
- **Ethics** (e.g., data sovereignty, sustainability).

## **A Personal Note**
I grew up in **Cameroon**, where technological resources are scarce but potential is vast. This fuels my drive to create **relevant, accessible, and empowering** solutions. I reject the idea that cutting-edge technology must be **exclusive or exploitative**—and I’m here to prove it.
